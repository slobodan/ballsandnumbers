Hey there! Thanks for landing on this page. It means you either likes my content enough to want to know a thing or two about me, or your Googling skills are REALLY bad. Either way, thank you.

My name is Slobodan Manic, I'm a web developer currently living in Sweden. Web development is something I've been doing for almost ten years, and I probably wouldn't even look elsewhere had I not run into Andrew Garcia Phillips' website <a href="http://www.chartball.com/">Chartball</a> a few years ago. That planted the seed (People get paid for doing THIS? Sign me up!), so like anyone else would in that situation I started learning everything there is about data analysis, data visualization, data mining, data scraping, statistical programming etc. You name it, I thought I had to know it.

Luckily, I ran into <a href="https://pudding.cool/">Polygraph (now Pudding)</a>, weekly journal of visual essays, and their NBA Redraft story and I knew then and there, this was exactly what I wanted to do. This website is documentation of my learning process, it started with some basic D3 examples, but is now moving to more complex stories. 

I will forever be greatful to those who inspired me and made sitting in front of a computer a lot of fun again.
