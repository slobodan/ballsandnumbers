<p>On December 10th 1996, Gregg Popovich was named head coach of San Antonio Spurs in a hire that gave Spurs their eighth head coach in ten years and had no business changing the NBA landscape for good.</p>

<p>Fast forward twenty one years and it is impossible to imagine the Spurs without Popovich. Over the years, Pop worked with 17 assistant coaches (6 went on to become head coaches with other NBA franchises) and 161 players, won five championships and somehow only three Coach of The Year awards.</p>

<p>Chart below shows every assistant and every player that ever was a member of Pop's Spurs. Click year to filter people only from that season.</p>
